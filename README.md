# 🐝 Swarmyard

> **A strategy bot playground where algorithms roam free.**

Swarmyard is a laid-back yet mildly ambitious project where multiple autonomous trading bots, each powered by a different strategy, compete and cooperate in a simulated (and optionally real) forex market environment.

The entire system can toggle between real and demo modes, and each bot operates independently. KPIs are collected for each one, giving you a dashboard view of who's thriving and who's just vibing.

It's carefully designed... but casually implemented. Some days it's full steam ahead, other times it's "eh, maybe next week." 

In the end, it's all about the joy of watching little bots do stuff while numbers wiggle and graphs appear.

## 👾 What is this?
- A playground for forex trading bots
- A place to benchmark different strategies against each other
- A unified API and data layer for analyzing performance
- Possibly a future tax report assistant (no promises)

---

## 🙃 FYI
- Not running in production (yet?)
- Will it ever be "done"? unclear.
- It's serious fun, but still just fun

---

## 💬 Maybe I'll do this, maybe I won't
- Add more bots (depends on my mood)
- Spice up the dashboard with fancy graphs (eventually)
- Grow a heart strong enough to handle real-mode losses (WIP)

## 📂 Project Structure

See `AGENTS.md` for full guidelines. This repository follows a microservice layout:

```
apps/           # Go services and frontend dashboard
api/proto/      # gRPC definitions
pkg/            # Shared Go packages
deploy/         # Docker Compose setup
```

Run `docker compose -f deploy/compose.yaml up` to start all services in development mode.
